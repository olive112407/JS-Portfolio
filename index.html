        <h2>About me: 
        </h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Oliver. Born in November 24th, 2007. I'm 14 years old and currently attending the Moors Alhambra Highschool. On my free time I enjoy playing games with friends and learning new dance moves. 
        I have lots of experience in sports. I've played soccer for 6 years and basketball for 1 year. I was also a sports director organizing sports tournaments for my school and was a refferee in the tournament. I have tutored piers on math and english as well. In my school I got a Principal's Honor Roll, Perfect Attendance Certificate, and a Graduation Certificate. I am trilingual in Spanish, English, and Cantonese.  I studied code in All Star Code for 4 weeks and learned the fundamentals of javascript. I learned html, stylecss, sketchjss, and more. In All Star Code I have done projects such as creating my own p5 programming game, creating my own copy website, and creathing this portfolio as well. Currently I am interested in either continuing my knowledge on coding or trying to become a firefighter. Why would I continue coding? I would continue coding to keep on learning new skills that are really cool such as designing websites or creating video games! Becoming a firefighter sounded interesting to me because of how relaxed the work place is. For example, firefighters are usually cleaning their trucks, working out, playing with fellow crewmates, and looking at small paperwork. Then its when firefighters then go out to stop fires and save people. The thrill of it and saving a life is what really makes me feel excited and proud of myself. What this says about me is that I like the thrill and excitement a job can provide me or something that can peak my curiosity to continue to work.
